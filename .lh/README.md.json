The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.\n\n## Code scaffolding\n\nAngular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:\n\n```bash\nng generate component component-name\n```\n\nFor a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:\n\n```bash\nng generate --help\n```\n\n## Building\n\nTo build the project run:\n\n```bash\nng build\n```\n\nThis will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.\n\n## Running unit tests\n\nTo execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nng test\n```\n\n## Running end-to-end tests\n\nFor end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:\n\n```bash\nng e2e\n```\n\nAngular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nFor more information on using the Angular CLI, including detailed command references, visit the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.\n"
